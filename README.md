# Entity Framework Exercises

This is a test-driven development (TDD) project designed to help students learn Entity Framework Core through practical exercises.

Clone the repo and run tests with "dotnet test" in same directory as *.csporj file. Make sure you have Docker installed and running! (Due to TestContainers)

Currently it has guided solutions, so go to the Setup.cs file and replace the DI implementation class with your own class (or simply remove implmentations in the "Exercises" folder)
